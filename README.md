# Text-Editor
Challenge 19

Description

This project is for self-improvement and practice in order to provide myself with confidence within this industry.

This is a single page progressive web application that runs a text editor in the browswer - online & offline.

This application uses Webpack, Node.js, Express.js, and JavaScript.


Installation

To install the project:

In the Terminal -

npm i

npm start

Go to your browser -

http://localhost:PORT#

OR click on the deployed link below.

Usage

When the text application is executed in the terminal, the backend initiates and serves content to the client. 

JavaScript files are combined using webpack, resulting in the creation of an HTML file, service worker, and manifest file.

If information is inputted by the user into the text editor, the data is stored in the IndexedDB once the mouse loses focus (moves away).

This stored data is then used to repopulate the text editor upon next use/reload.

Clicking Install on the Top Left side will install the application onto your computer for use OFFLINE.
